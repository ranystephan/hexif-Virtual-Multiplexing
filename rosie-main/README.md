# ROSIE Model Training and Evaluation

This repository contains code for training and evaluating the ROSIE (Robust Segmentation of Image Elements) model for histopathology image analysis.

## Directory Structure

- `train.py` - Training script for the ROSIE model
- `evaluate.py` - Evaluation and inference script
- `models/` - Model architecture definitions
- `utils/` - Helper functions and utilities
- `configs/` - Configuration files for different experiments
- `data/` - Data loading and preprocessing code

## Overview

This codebase provides a starting point for training and evaluating the ROSIE model on histopathology images. The model is designed for robust segmentation and analysis of tissue structures in H&E stained slides.

## Getting Started

1. Install required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)
2. Configure experiment parameters in `configs/`
3. Run training using `train.py`
4. Evaluate model performance with `evaluate.py`
